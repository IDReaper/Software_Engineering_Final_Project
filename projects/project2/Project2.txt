1. A formal description of the software product in one single paragraph (for you to use noun extraction to draw entity classes) (10%).
We can look at appendix to answer this.

2. Normal scenarios of three non-trivial use cases (15%). 
**** Fix these on our use cases ****
Non-trivial use case: Manage member and provider accounts need to be two separate use cases, because we have two separate tabs on our gui.
Non-trivial use case: 

3. A statechart of the system (15%).
Refer to figure 13.7 on page 415 for a statechart of a system example.
On our gui we can three interfaces with tabs on two of them.

4. Collaboration diagrams and/or sequence diagrams for each of the non-trivial use cases (30%).
Refer to 436-452 (sequence diagrams) which go hand in hand.

5. The last refined version of the overall class diagram (20%).
Refer to page 438, figure 13.34 is an exampe of class diagram and figure 13.36 is another example 

6. A log file that records every task each team member has done and each team activity including dates. 
   Also indicate the percentage each team member has contributed to the project (The total is 100%) (10%).
Need to indicate the percentage for each group member.
